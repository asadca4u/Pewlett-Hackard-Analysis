# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- Pewlet Hackard has a large population of ageing workers, which poses the issue of non-disruptive worker succession. 
- The company would like us to sort through the databases of workers at all levels of the organization and compile lists of those who may seek to retire in the next few years, namely those whose birthdays were between the years of 1952 and 1955. 
- In addition, the company would like to use some of the older workers, whose birth year is 1965 giving them atleast 10 years before retirement, as mentors for newer workers to minimize any disruptions caused by the transition. 
  - This will require detailed lists of all senior employees sorted by department and title, who may be eligible for the mentorship role so that individual assignments may be made. 

### Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
Deliverable 1:
- In figure 1, we can see that there are nearly twice as many senior employees as junior employees at the company who are between the ages of 62 and 65 who will need replacing within the next 3 years. Such a top heavy corporate heiararchy faces great disruptions when mass retiring waves occur in each of the next 3 years. 
- Also in Figure 1, there are only two people within 3 years of retiring who hold the title of manager in the company, and so the management structure is not nescessarily in danger to the retirement waves.

###### Figure 1: Sum total of employees at Pewlett Hackard by Title

Deliverable 2:
- There are 1,940 employees who were born in the year 1965 at the company, and would have atleast 10 years to mentor employees at the company.
- Interesting to note that all employees who were born in the year 1965 have a birthday in either January or February only. 

### Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
##### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- As we can see in Figure 1, there are 45,397 engineers in the company who are atleast 62 years old in the year 2020, given that the age of retirement is 65, they would have less than 3 years to train as many new engineers as well as younger current employees to fill these roles at a proficient level.
- Similarly, there are 40,497 staff at the company who are atleast 62 years old, who must all be replaced in the next three years. Although the cost may be high in the transitionary years with so many new hires being employed at the same time as their older counter parts, the savings in productivity that will not be lost in the long term, should make up the difference, especially if the older employees accept part time roles instead. 
##### Additional Possible Queries
- Wider queries may be made allowing for more than just the employees born in the year 1965, in order to see how the demographics of the company change at the lower age ranges in each department, with more top heavy departments receiving additional hires to be mentored by the older employees. 
- Salaries may be examined at different age levels, showing the savings made by phasing out an older work force, who would presumably receive higher salaries due to years of experieince, with younger workers who would have yet to prove themselves, earning lower salaries as a result.
